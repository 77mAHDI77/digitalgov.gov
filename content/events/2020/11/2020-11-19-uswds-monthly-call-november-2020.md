Join U.S. Web Design System Product Lead, Dan Williams, to hear about what's next for the design system as we come to the end of 2020. During this event, the design system team will discuss what we've learned this year and how we're thinking about the future of the design system.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.

USWDS is a library of principles, guidance, and code to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices.
