Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) receives many requests for plain language workshops. Since March, we’ve not been able to go to agencies to train, since many buildings are closed and most federal employees working from home. However, agencies still want training.

Since many of our trainers are not used to training remotely, we’d like to use this huddle session to discuss best practices, lessons learned, and what not to do. Whether or not you’re a trainer, if you’ve attended a remote session, please attend and share your ideas.
