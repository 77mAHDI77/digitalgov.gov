Often, getting started with Google Analytics seems daunting; a new interface, new terms, and new things to understand. In this session, we’ll try to get you acquainted with the Google Analytics interface, show you how DAP is unique, review common terminology, and get your feet wet with the basic reports you can use to analyze your web traffic.

**Speakers**

**Tim Lowden** manages the federal government's aggregated web analytics initiative, the Digital Analytics Program (DAP), at the General Services Administration. The DAP aims to help agencies better understand the public's interaction with the federal digital space, and records over 2.5 billion pageviews on more than 5,000 federal government websites each month. Much of this data is available to the public at analytics.usa.gov.

Prior to his government service, he worked at the UN's International Labour Organization. He is a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer who served in Morocco from '08-'10 and holds degrees from SUNY Buffalo and the George Washington University.

**Freddie Blicher** is a Google Analytics Consultant at MetroStar Systems, and supports the Digital Analytics Program as a DAP Analyst. He is also an instructor at General Assembly in Washington, DC teaching Intro and Bootcamp courses on Google Analytics. He has experience in Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, IBM Analytics, and Webtrends and has worked with e-commerce, government, and non-profit clients such as Hilton Worldwide, Audi USA, Macys.com, Marriott International, Ritz-Carlton, GSA DAP, and others.
