The U.S. government spends billions of dollars annually on information technology (IT). Whether sustaining legacy systems or procuring highly customized applications, the costs add up.

So it’s not surprising that the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html) pinpoints IT modernization as a key driver of transformation—capable of speeding service delivery, cutting costs to taxpayers, and improving how citizens interact with, perceive, and trust federal agencies.
  
[Code.gov](http://www.code.gov), a program known for maintaining “America’s code,” is working toward that mission with a crowdsourcing call-to-action to software designers, developers, and other civic-tech professionals from industry to iterate on open-source code solutions with federal colleagues.

Managed by the General Services Administration (GSA), Code.gov hosts an [Open Task Repository](https://code.gov/open-tasks), a collection of open-source software projects listed by federal agencies as open for collaboration. Governed by the program’s recently updated [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://medium.com/codedotgov/new-decade-new-code-gov-code-of-conduct-d8402a79a34b), the program is building an inclusive and collegial community with technologists across the country.

Join us to find out how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, GSA and the Defense, Energy, and Health and Human Services departments are crowdsourcing for code with more than 50 open tasks currently listed in the repo.

This talk was hosted by [Challenge.gov](http://www.challenge.gov). Managed by GSA, Challenge.gov serves as both the official listing of prize competitions across government, as well as a centralized platform for federal agencies to market their problem-solving events. The program also designs resources and training, which have helped more than 100 federal agencies run over 900 prize competitions with public participation since 2010.
