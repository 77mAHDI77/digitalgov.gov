Understanding how to pull reporting in Google Analytics is only part of the puzzle. Google Analytics tells you the "Who", the "How" and the "What" — but it doesn't tell you the "Why". In this webinar, we'll connect the dots between your organization's website strategy to help you better navigate how to think about the "Why", and how assessing your analytics strategy cascades throughout your DAP Google Analytics reporting experience. We'll illustrate how your strategy serves as the linchpin and foundation of your website reporting, and provide some helpful guidance and tips on assessing your strategy.

**Speaker:**

**Freddie Blicher** is a Google Analytics Consultant at MetroStar Systems, and supports the Digital Analytics Program as a DAP Analyst. He is also an instructor at General Assembly in Washington, DC teaching Google Analytics Intro and Bootcamp courses. He has experience in Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, IBM Analytics and Webtrends and has worked with e-commerce, government and non-profit clients such as Hilton Worldwide, Audi USA, Macys.com, Marriott International, Ritz-Carlton, GSA DAP and others.
