This month, Dan Williams, USWDS product lead, and 18F teammates will talk about how the design system helps teams build better sites faster. They’ll also discuss why, even when using a design system like USWDS, teams still need a designer.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.

USWDS is a library of principles, guidance, and code to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices.
