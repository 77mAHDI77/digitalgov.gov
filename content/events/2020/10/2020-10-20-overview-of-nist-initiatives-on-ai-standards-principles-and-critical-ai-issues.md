AI has the potential to impact nearly all aspects of our society, including our economy, but the development and use of the new technologies it brings are not without technical challenges and risks. AI must be developed in a trustworthy manner to ensure reliability, safety and accuracy. 

Elham Tabassi and Mark Przybocki will provide an overview of ongoing [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) efforts supporting fundamental and applied research and standards for AI technologies.
