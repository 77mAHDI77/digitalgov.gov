The U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) is a toolkit of principles, guidance, and code that you can use to build accessible, mobile-friendly government websites.
 
Please join Dan Williams, USWDS product lead, as he kicks off 2020 with an in-depth exploration of the USWDS [maturity model](https://designsystem.digital.gov/maturity-model/). Dan will walk through how you can use the maturity model to make small, incremental changes to modernize your website.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.

[**USWDS**](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)Â is a library of code, tools, and guidance to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices.
