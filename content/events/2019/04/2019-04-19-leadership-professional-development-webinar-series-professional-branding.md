Reginald Gant, a Human Resources Specialist for the Office of Learning, Strategy, and Workforce Development at the Social Security Administration, will be discussing what branding is, why it is important, and the 6-step branding process.

The Federal Leadership and Professional Development Seminar Series provides no cost “by government/for government” seminars that are presented by federal experts to employees across the government to share federal leader expertise and lessons learned; provide free training, as training resources are always limited; and bring individuals together from across the federal government and foster intra- and inter-agency connections, collaborations, and sharing. 

This talk is hosted by AHRQ and Digital.gov.  To receive seminar invitations and resources, you may join the seminar series listserv by sending a blank email from your government email address to FedLeadershipSeminar-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov.  Past seminar recordings are available at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ1wh1JcX9nwin7w1f_S3fQ.
