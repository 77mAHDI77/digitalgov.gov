The General Services Administration (GSA) is holding a coast-to-coast hackathon on Wednesday, June 19, 2019, aimed at bettering the customer experience of products in government.

Throughout the federal government, as described in the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html), improving customer experience is a top priority. Customer experience can refer to the external customers and internal customers. This hackathon, we will be focusing on both. The participants will be including the newly-released [U.S. Web Design System 2.0](https://digital.gov/2019/04/08/introducing-uswds-2/) in their solutions.

Throughout this all-day hackathon, taking place simultaneously at eight GSA locations nationwide, participants will evaluate real-world products and iterate on ideas for making the customer experience better in GSA applications.

2. Chicago, IL

## Who Is Invited?

GSA seeks application developers interested in User Experience (UX) to participate.

The goals of this day are to:

- Work on GSA Applications that’ll make an impact across government in a short amount of time
- Meet other practitioners
- Have fun

**NOTE**

- Federal employee cannot participate
- Federal grantees may not use federal funds to develop competition solutions unless consistent with the purpose of their grant award.
- Federal contractors may not use federal funds from a contract to develop competition applications or to fund efforts in support of a competition entry.

## What We’ll Be Hacking On

Participants will be hacking on applications that are core to GSA operations. Your ideas will help these services to have a greater impact in government.

## What Is Customer Experience, and What Does This Mean for Government?

Customer Experience (CX) is the journey a customer has while interacting with products and brands. CX has gained a lot of attention within government, and our aim is to better the customer experience for external and internal interaction with government agencies, products, technology and people.


## What to Bring

- [A government-issued ID](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/identification.html) — you will need to go through security.
- Your own laptop and power cord.
- Headphones.
- Personal water bottle, if desired.
- Your own lunch, if desired - the hackathon schedule does not provide for a dedicated lunch break, so if you prefer to work through lunch time, please bring your own lunch. It will be time-consuming to go in and out of the government buildings.
