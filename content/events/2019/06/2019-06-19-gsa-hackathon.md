The General Services Administration (GSA) is holding a coast-to-coast hackathon on Wednesday, June 19, 2019, aimed at bettering the customer experience of products in government.

Throughout the federal government, as described in the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html), improving customer experience is a top priority. Customer experience can refer to the external customers and internal customers. This hackathon, we will be focusing on both. The participants will be including the newly-released [U.S. Web Design System 2.0](https://digital.gov/2019/04/08/introducing-uswds-2/) in their solutions.

Throughout this all-day hackathon, taking place simultaneously at eight GSA locations nationwide, participants will evaluate real-world products and iterate on ideas for making the customer experience better in GSA applications.


## Participating Cities

1. Boston, MA
2. Chicago, IL
3. Ft Worth, TX
4. Kansas City, MO
5. New York City, NY
6. Philadelphia, PA
7. San Francisco, CA
8. Washington, DC.

## Who Is Invited?

GSA seeks application developers interested in User Experience (UX) to participate.

The goals of this day are to:

- Work on GSA Applications that’ll make an impact across government in a short amount of time
- Meet other practitioners
- Have fun

**NOTE**

- Federal employee cannot participate
- Federal grantees may not use federal funds to develop competition solutions unless consistent with the purpose of their grant award.
- Federal contractors may not use federal funds from a contract to develop competition applications or to fund efforts in support of a competition entry.

## What We’ll Be Hacking On

Participants will be hacking on applications that are core to GSA operations. Your ideas will help these services to have a greater impact in government.

## What Is Customer Experience, and What Does This Mean for Government?

Customer Experience (CX) is the journey a customer has while interacting with products and brands. CX has gained a lot of attention within government, and our aim is to better the customer experience for external and internal interaction with government agencies, products, technology and people.


## What to Bring

- [A government-issued ID](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/identification.html) — you will need to go through security.
- Your own laptop and power cord.
- Headphones.
- Personal water bottle, if desired.
- Your own lunch, if desired - the hackathon schedule does not provide for a dedicated lunch break, so if you prefer to work through lunch time, please bring your own lunch. It will be time-consuming to go in and out of the government buildings.

## Cash Awards

GSA anticipates awarding four cash prizes, for a $20,000 total prize purse: four application-specific teams will be selected in the first round of judging to be eligible for a cash prize of $2,500 and move onto Round 2 judging. Of those, one solution will then be selected in Round 2 judging, and a $10,000 grand prize will be awarded that team, for a total of $12,500. Team application projects will be evaluated in accordance with the judging criteria outlined below.

Prizes will be distributed to the eligible winners via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), within 60 business days of the announcement of the winner(s). GSA will distribute the funds evenly to all team members listed in the original registrations who arrive at the Security Desk at their respective locations for the competition start time of 10:00am ET and stay for the full day (10:00 am - 4:00 pm, ET). Funding for this hackathon will come from GSA.

## How Does Judging Work?

10:00 am - 3:00 pm — Hacking
3:00 - 4:00 pm — Round 1 judging, winners announced
4:00 - 5:00 pm — Round 2 judging, winner announced

_A full schedule for the day will be posted in the coming weeks. _

### Round 1

The hacking ends at 3:00 pm, ET. Each team will have an equitable amount of time to present their solutions to a judging panel of 3 to 4 federal employees and the other teams until all teams have presented. After Round 1 judging is complete and winners are announced, the winners of Round 1 will move on to Round 2 judging.

### Round 2

During Round 2, one winner will be selected by a federal executive judging panel and announced at 5:00 pm, ET.

All presentations and judging will take place virtually through video conferencing software and equipment provided by GSA, and in-person at 1800 F St NW, Washington, DC 20405.

Registered participants at the eight GSA locations nationwide will be evaluated equitably and there will be no advantage given to participants who are in-person at 1800 F St NW, Washington, DC 20405 .

### Presentations

Each team will present to a judging panel their solution for up to three minutes. In Round 1, each pool of competitors will only present and be judged against the same problem set. The judges will be evaluating each solution as if they are the application user. The round will be judged based on the following criteria with each judge independently scoring the solution on a scale of 1 to 5; for more information, please see the [Round 1 Judging Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/open?id=10BjnvPjGnflCrckbCJv6YKzBqPmZtLY650NMLGxElUU).
