Alex S. and Alex Y. are here to show you how to host the best office dance party in a matter of minutes.

### STEP 1: Choose your space
Don’t fret if you don’t have a large cubicle or office space. You just need enough room for a few people to spin around. Consider using your largest space and rearranging some furniture to make an open spot for guests to move.

### STEP 2: The guest list
Include at least a few guests who have a penchant for dancing. They can help set the stage for the event.

### STEP 3: Prepare the music
Since this is a dance party, it’s critical that you have good music. Create your playlist with song choices that will match the dancing. A variety of songs will ensure everyone hears something they love.

### STEP 4: Set the mood
A basic pair of sunglassess might be all you need to signify to guests that party time is about to begin. Keep it fun!

### STEP 5: Prepare some snacks and drinks
Guests will work up an appetite and a thirst with all that dancing. You might want to have water and a few snacks on hand. Providing tasty snacks will allow guests to grab for a quick bite before heading to their next meeting.

### STEP 6: Party time
It’s time to dance! Now that you’ve done all the leg work, it’s time to get those legs working on the dance floor!
