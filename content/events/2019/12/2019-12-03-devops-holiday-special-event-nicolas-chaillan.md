We will share how the Department of Defense (DoD) moved to DevSecOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery by leveraging Kubernetes (an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) compliant containers.

It demonstrates how 37 weapon, business and cyber systems are moving to DevSecOps best practices, including leveraging the DoD DevSecOps Reference Design and the Continuous Authority to Operate.
