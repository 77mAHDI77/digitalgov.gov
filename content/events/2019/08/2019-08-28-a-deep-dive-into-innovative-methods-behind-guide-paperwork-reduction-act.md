In June, the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and Digital.gov launched the [Guide to the Paperwork Reduction Act](https://pra.digital.gov/) (PRA)—a plain language guide that answers the most common questions people have around the PRA. It aims to give confidence to federal employees when working with the PRA—and through this, lowers the barriers to working effectively with the public.

The PRA Guide is a product of [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov/), a new and innovative fund for ideas in government, and was built and designed by a team at [18F](https://www.18f.gov/).

In this talk, we’ll cover how the PRA guide came about and explore the methods that the team used to break down the complexity around this complicated requirement and get a product launched in just a few months. We’ll also be taking questions.

We’ll also talk with the team from OIRA about how they arrived at the idea to submit a pitch to 10x in the first place, and what new things they’ve learned about building a product from the ground up.
