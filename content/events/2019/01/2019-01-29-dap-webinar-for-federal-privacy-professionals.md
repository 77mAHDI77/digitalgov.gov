For this event, we have partnered with the fine folks who run the Federal Privacy Council's Tech Tuesday Series!

Do you ever wonder how many visitors your agency's privacy website gets, what they search for, how long they stay, and if they are mobile users?

Do your SAOP or any other agency officials ask how well your privacy website and resources are serving your users?

Have you considered whether you can create a better user experience for the public?

Join us to learn the answers to all those questions and to answer some of yours!

In this webinar, Tim Lowden, Program Manager for the Digital Analytics Program, will give a brief introduction of the initiative itself, and also give you insight into how you can use the DAP Google Analytics account to view data about the privacy-related pages on your website. Join us to learn how to measure, analyze, and improve experiences for users visiting privacy pages on your agency websites.
