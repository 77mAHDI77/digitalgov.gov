_For this event, we have partnered with the fine folks who run the [Federal Privacy Council](https://www.fpc.gov/)'s Tech Tuesday Series!_ 

* Do you ever wonder how many visitors your agency's privacy website gets, what they search for, how long they stay, and if they are mobile users? 
* Do your SAOP or any other agency officials ask how well your privacy website and resources are serving your users? 
* Have you considered whether you can create a better user experience for the public?

Join us to learn the answers to all those questions&mdash;and to answer some of yours!

In this webinar, [Tim Lowden](https://digital.gov/authors/tlowden/), Program Manager for the [Digital Analytics Program](https://digital.gov/dap/), will give a brief introduction of the initiative itself, and give you insight into how you can use the DAP Google Analytics account to view data about the privacy-related pages on your website. Join us to learn how to measure, analyze, and improve experiences for users visiting privacy pages on your agency websites.
