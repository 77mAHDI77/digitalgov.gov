The Summit will have 3 tracks of presentations, so there will be something for everyone:

- UX Methods 
- UX Management 
- Design in UX 
  
Speakers represent agencies across the government, sharing case studies, the latest best practices in UX methods, and strategies for UX management. 

Lunch to follow in the BLS cafeteria for those who wish to stay. 

We expect to have the final program available in early April.

_The UX CoP is a group of more than 1,100 federal, state, and local U.S. government employees and contractors who are interested in applying UX methods to create efficient, effective, and useful products and systems. Â We provide training, networking, and support for government UX practitioners. Anyone with an interest in UX and a US government email address is encouraged to join._
