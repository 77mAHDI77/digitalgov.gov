Please join Dan Williams, U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) product lead, for an overview of the development process for a USWDS component. This month we’re going to take a step back and answer the question: just what is a design system? And to answer that question we’ll talk about how a design system like USWDS help teams design and build dynamic and effective government websites. So if you or someone on your team is interested in design system basics, join Dan Williams, USWDS project lead, to discuss The Rules of Play: Creativity and Constraint in the U.S. Web Design System.

This event is part of a monthly series that generally takes place on the third Thursday of each month. The video will be available on Digital.gov shortly after the event.

USWDS is a library of code, tools, and guidance to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices.
