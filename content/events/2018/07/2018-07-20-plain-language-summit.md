Plain language makes it easier for the public to read, understand, and use government communications.

The federal Plain Language community is holding their first all-day summit in Washington D.C., and you’re invited!

On Friday, July 20th, we’ll bring together some of the brightest individuals working in government for a one-day series of talks and conversations on how to advance plain language on government communications.

Join us in-person or online to learn about the importance of plain language, methods for implementing it, and strike a conversation with fellow communicators from across government.

The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) is a group of federal employees from different agencies and specialties who support the use of clear communication in government writing. Visit [plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) or [join the community](https://digital.gov/communities/plain-language/).


## Audience
Federal employees who are interested in plain language and want to learn more.
