Join us for a mostly in-person meeting on Wednesday December 12, 2018 from 2:00 to 3:30 p.m. ET where we'll discuss about Clarity 2018 conference in Montreal and plan out our 2019 meetings. We realize not everyone can join us in person, but we'll arrange a Zoom video conference so you can see and hear us. 

This is our traditional winter finger-food potluck. Please bring something to share that doesn't need reheating.
