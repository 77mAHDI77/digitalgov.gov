Join us for a mostly in-person meeting on Wednesday December 12, 2018 from 2:00 to 3:30 p.m. ET. Our traditional winter finger-food potluck features discussion about the Clarity 2018 Montreal conference and planning our 2019 meetings.

Please bring something to share that doesn't need reheating. 

Meet us at GSA, 1800 F Street, NW, Room 4143. 

We realize not everyone can join us in person, but we'll arrange a Zoom video conference so you can see and hear us.
