_The DAP ([Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/)) Learning Series online trainings are designed for DAP users to increase their skills and understanding of topics relevant to DAP’s implementation of Google Analytics_

In both our [DAP 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxNQNL8-kLo&t=7s) and [DAP 201](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbCEAglfFsc&t=2s) classes we covered events in Google Analytics. In this online class, we’ll focus entirely on events.

You’ll learn: 

- What is an event
- What represents an event on your site?
- What events DAP tracks by default
- What event category, action and label mean
- How to pull events in reporting using both standard and customized reporting
