In our next monthly users call, [the U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/) core team will share what they’re working on in 2018, including:

- changing our name to more accurately describe what we are and what we do
- more specific design and implementation guidance
- easier ways to prototype and build consistently and incrementally
- clearer connections between user research and guidance
- a path to contribute components and research back to the system

**Presenters:**

- Maya Benari
- John Donmoyer
- Dan Williams

Please join us on Zoom, on **January 26 at 1pm ET**, to hear from the team and ask your questions.

_This talk is open to federal employees who work on digital projects that could use the Web Design Standards._
