Join us for our first Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) Monthly meeting of 2018. The topic for this meeting will be determined.

Hosted by Digital Gov, meetings are in-person, online, or a mix of both. They are recorded and posted to Digital Gov's YouTube channel.
 
In addition to addressing timely topics, like science communications and health literacy, typical discussions include: plain language training; hands-on editing exercises; how to write for web and social media; and content strategy.
