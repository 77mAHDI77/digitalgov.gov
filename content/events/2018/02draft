This meeting will be focused in person, but we&#39;ll have a conference bridge line so people who are remote can  still join in the discussion&#46;

One thing&#58; To volunteer, you have to be a federal employee&#46; Sorry&#46; We know many of you are eager to help us out, but according to our charter rules, we can only use feds&#46;

Be prepared to discuss what you&#39;d like to do&#46; Here are some ideas&#58;
