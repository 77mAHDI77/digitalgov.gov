This quarterly meeting brings together federal employees from a range of agencies to discuss trends, success stories and lessons learned in the use of crowdsourcing competitions.

At this meeting, attendees will:

- Meet and greet the Special Assistant to the President for Innovation Policy and Initiatives and hear his vantage point from within the White House Office of American Innovation.
- Hear how a DARPA challenge to forecast the spread of infectious disease is pinpointing where to perform clinical trials on a new vaccine for the chikungunya virus.
- Learn about using challenges in humanitarian efforts from the U.S. Agency for International Development and others.
- Explore the role of accelerators in advancing research and fostering entrepreneurship through a panel discussion featuring the Small Business Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
- Examine how agencies are using different legal authorities, including the Joint Venture Partnership Authority.

And as always, there will be plenty of time before, after, and in between these presentations networking with new and familiar colleagues across the government with a shared commitment to thinking outside the box to solve problems.

**Who Should Attend**

Members of the Federal Challenges & Prizes Community of Practice, program managers, contracting and procurement staff, communications teams, legal staff, and other federal employees who manage or work on crowdsourcing, challenge, and incentivized prize competitions, and other open innovation practices. We also welcome our colleagues from the citizen science and ideation communities of practice to join us for the training and networking.
