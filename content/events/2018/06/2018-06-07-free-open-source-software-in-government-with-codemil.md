Join the [Code.mil](Code.mil) team for a discussion on open source in government and a look at the important work they've been doing on Code.mil to enable greater adoption of open source at the DoD.

They will cover:

- What is open source and why is it so important?
- How can open source code reduce risk, cost and time to delivery?
- A look at common myths of open source in government
- What is the goal of Code.mil? How does it tie into the larger view of open source software in government?

The [Code.mil](Code.mil) team will give an overview of the **recent refresh of Code.mil** where itâ€™s possible to contribute code and see it go live almost immediately! This refresh empowers the DoD to accelerate open source participation across government and improve open source guidance.


### About Code.mil

In February 2017 the Defense Digital Service (DDS) started a conversation with the Free and Open Source Software (F/OSS) community on how the DoD could better open source code. That dialogue produced a lot of guidance on how the DoD can open source projects, but the information was all on GitHub and not very accessible.


### Speakers
- **Ari Chivukula:** Policy wrangler working with the US Digital Service team at Department of Defense in cloud security, cyber warfare, and open source.
- **Jordan Kasper:** Evangelist, developer, community organizer, open sourcer (and he's been called worse). Currently improving tech at the US Digital Service.
