Emerging technology solutions including Artificial Intelligence, Robotic Process Automation and Blockchain employed by agencies across government, combined with the operational rigor and funding of the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF), hold the potential to drive to incredible performance enhancements in public services.

[GSA’s Emerging Citizen Technology Office](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/emerging-citizen-technology) (ECTO) and the [Technology Modernization Fund Program Management Office](https://emerging.digital.gov/TMF/) (TMF PMO) are hosting a workshop at GSA on June 8, 2018 to hands-on assist agencies with developing proposals for TMF that advance emerging technologies and programs that can improve our services and reduce costs for the American people today and in the coming years.

For more information, please email [EmergingTech@GSA.gov](EmergingTech@GSA.gov) with “#TMF” in the subject line. 

**What is the Technology Modernization Fund?**

The TMF provides a new funding model for Federal technology modernization projects. Agencies may submit project proposals for technology modernization projects to the Technology Modernization Board (Board). For FY 2018, the Board received $100 million for upfront funding for projects projects. Approved projects will receive funds in an incremental manner, tied to specific project milestones and objectives, and will be regularly monitored by the Board for success. Agencies then repay the TMF over a period of years. 

**What projects qualify for the Technology Modernization Fund?**

The Board will consider project proposals based on financial, technical, and operational criteria. All federal government agencies can submit project proposals to the TMF. A full list of requirements for submission, as well as a template, can be found in [Appendix A of OMB M-18-12](https://policy.cio.gov/modernizing-government-technology/). A [word document template](https://policy.cio.gov/assets/APPENDIXA.docx) can also be found on the OMB Modernizing Government Technology site.

### What to Expect

Participants should expect to come with basic ideas for programs they would like to potentially submit to the Technology Modernization Fund process, have all their questions answered, and spend two sessions working side-by-side with the TMF PMO, ECTO and others to craft proposals that deliver the greatest benefit to our modernization efforts while meeting the technical standards of the fund process. 

### Agenda:

### Who Should Attend

Great ideas for modernizing our public services should come from anywhere, whether civilian agencies, the Defense Community or the Intelligence Community, whether federal managers or their support teams and innovative businesses. Projects for the Technology Modernization Fund can be both Classified and Unclassified, and can include the widest spectrum of capabilities, technologies and approaches. All are encouraged to take advantage of this opportunity. 

We encourage diverse stakeholder teams of up to four to assemble that are sponsored by a federal agency and include either federal employees or contractors working in an official capacity for their agency. 

Registrants will be asked to identify their agency Point of Contact and briefly outline their concepts in order to help us prepare to support their needs and answer questions. 

Remote participation is possible for teams assembling outside of the Washington, D.C. area.

### Registration Requirements

In order to complete your registration, we’d like to know a little bit more about your initial idea so we know how we can best help you. You'll be prompted to answer these questions as briefly as possible when you register, and remember that these details can change and evolve as you learn more about the Technology Modernization Fund and how it can best serve your mission. 

1. What is the name of your idea?
2. Who is the main Point of Contact or Sponsor of this idea?
3. Describe how the proposed idea fulfills your Agency’s mission, and identify the problem this solves. (1-2 sentences)
4. Provide an initial rough estimation of the TMF funding request. (1 sentence)
5. Identify basic metrics for success and any initial milestones for implementation. (2 sentences)
6. Describe why the project will succeed, citing examples such as: (1) executive level support for this effort, (2) the strength or experience of the team, including any agency digital service experts, other agency development resources, the availability of contractor support (3) the preparedness to begin executing this project, and (4) other relevant factors that will demonstrate the likelihood of project success. (1-3 sentences)
7. Describe why the Technology Modernization Fund makes sense for this project and how the approach you are taking for this effort is different than what you have previously attempted. (1-2 sentences)
