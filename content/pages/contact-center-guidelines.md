Contact Centers are becoming the hub for federal agencies to gather valuable, decision-making data to meet their missions. The Contact Center is no longer viewed as only a center to receive complaints, but as a valued operation in an agencyâ€™s strategy to deliver a quality customer experience. Customers want to speak to government agencies via Web, social media, and mobile technologies, not just by phone calls. Citizens engaging with federal agencies also expect timely, accurate responses to their questions and needs.
