There are great opportunities to solve the problems in your agencies and to engage your high-performing staff with cutting-edge projects across agency bounds.

<p style="text-align: left">
  Through our Open Opportunities in DigitalGov network, we&#8217;re building a cooperative enterprise that draws on resources from across government to leverage the expertise of forward-leaning agencies. We’re looking at innovative staffing arrangements, multi-agency teams, and ways to tap specialized expertise and skills for quick turnaround tasks.
