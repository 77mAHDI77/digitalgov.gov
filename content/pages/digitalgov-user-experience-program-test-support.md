Itâ€™s always best to test a product BEFORE you release it. So the best time to evaluate the usability of a product is as early as possible, including when you are creating wireframes and prototypes.

But even if youâ€™ve gone past that point (or even if your site is live) you can still find points of user frustration and fix them through a usability test or evaluation.

If you are considering running a usability test or other user experience service &#8211; great! We&#8217;d be happy to offer some pointers, point you towards some templates to save you time, or take a look at your script or test plan. Our goal is for agencies to do as much user research as they can, so [email us for test support](mailto:govux@gsa.gov) when you&#8217;re ready. Or check out our [Usability Starter Kit](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/user-experience-program/digitalgov-user-experience-program-usability-starter-kit/ "DigitalGov User Experience Program: Usability Starter Kit").

From time to time we will conduct a demonstrate test, evaluation or other service for educational purposes. On rare occasions we will select a high-impact site for testing purposes. Â We will post notices of our tests through [DigitalGov University](https://www.digitalgov.gov/digitalgov-university/).

Other options for getting a test off the ground are toÂ [hire a usability contractor](https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/s/search.do?q=0:2%22usability+testing%22&q=0:1%22usability+testing%22&db=1), or getÂ [trained](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/user-experience-program/usability-training-for-federal-employees/)Â yourself.
