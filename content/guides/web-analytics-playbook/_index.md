## Overview
Federal websites vary greatly in content and purpose, but they all share a common objective: to deliver information or services to the public in an efficient, easy, and accessible way. 

Web analytics tools play an integral role in pursuit of that goal. However, if the tool is implemented improperly or the data it collects are analyzed incorrectly, it can derail delivering information or services to the public.

Use these plays to help strategize how your team can most effectively use web analytics for your website and target audience.
