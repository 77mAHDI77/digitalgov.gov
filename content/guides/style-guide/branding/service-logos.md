## Branded names and initialisms or acronyms for related services and programs:

- **[Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digital.gov/dap/)** (DAP). Their dashboard, website domain, and name are the same: [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov)
- **[Search.gov](https://search.gov)**, _(formerly DigitalGov Search)_
- **[Digital.gov University](https://www.digital.gov/digitalgov-university/)** (DGU), _(formerly DigitalGov University)_

- **[U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)** (USWDS), _(formerly called the U.S. Web Design Standards)_

Additionally, we often abbreviate Community of Practice as CoP, and we have [over 27 communities](https://digital.gov/communities/) listed on Digital.gov. However, they are run by federal employees at agencies across the federal government, so they donâ€™t always follow the same naming conventions. If writing about them or topics covered in their listservs, you can get the full, proper name (and any alternates) from their individual Community pages on Digital.gov.

**Name examples include:** MobileGov, SocialGov, OpenGov, Open Data, PLAIN, Government Contact Center Council (G3C), Web Content Managers Forum, and Federal Community of Practice on Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (CCS).
