The overarching name of the site is **Digital.gov**. You may see references to "DigitalGov" in our archives, but going forward, it should be referred to as "Digital.gov".

### Branded names and initialisms or acronyms for related services and programs:

- **[Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digital.gov/dap/)** (DAP)
  - DAP’s dashboard website domain and name are the same: [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov)
- **DigitalGov Search** was renamed: **[Search.gov](https://www.digital.gov/services/search/)**
- **[Digital.gov University](https://www.digital.gov/digitalgov-university/)** (DGU)
- **[Emerging Citizen Technology Office](https://emerging.digital.gov/)** (ECTO)
- **[Federal CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program](https://www.digital.gov/services/mobile-application-testing-program/)** (no acronym)
- **[U.S. Digital Registry](https://www.digital.gov/services/u-s-digital-registry/)** (no acronym; replaced the Federal Social Media Registry and the Federal Mobile Products Registry)
- **U.S. Web Design Standards** was renamed: **[U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)** (USWDS)

Additionally, we often abbreviate Community of Practice as CoP, and we have [over 27 communities](https://digital.gov/communities/) listed on Digital.gov. However, they are run by federal employees at agencies across the federal government, so they don’t always follow the same naming conventions. If writing about them or topics covered in their listservs, you can get the full, proper name (and any alternates) from their individual Community pages on Digital.gov.

**Name examples include:** MobileGov, SocialGov, OpenGov, Open Data, PLAIN, Government Contact Center Council (G3C), Web Content Managers Forum, and Federal Community of Practice on Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (CCS).
