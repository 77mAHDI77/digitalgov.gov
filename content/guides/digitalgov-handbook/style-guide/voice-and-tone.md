## Conscious Inclusivity

Not everyone who uses government services or engages with federal agencies are U.S. citizens. When appropriate, use phrases or words such as: the public, users, people, or folks.

Additionally, where possible:

 * Avoid using gendered pronouns; instead, use they or their.
 * Avoid age-related descriptions of people unless absolutely necessary for the content; in those cases, try using older people or older personâ€”instead of elderly or senior.
