In general, we follow [AP Style](https://www.apstylebook.com/). Use [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) in your writing for clarity. Avoid using acronyms or [jargon](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/08/15/get-out-of-the-jargon-trap-plain-language-training-can-help/) that may be unfamiliar to the general public or those outside your agency.

## Capitalization

Capitalize proper nouns for people, places, and agency names.

Do not capitalize words like _federal_, _government_, or _agency_ unless it is:

 * The first word in a sentence
 * An official title for or name of something
 * In a title or header (see _Content Titles and Headers_ below)

## Publication Titles

Blogs, magazines, books, etc. are in normal text (i.e., no italics or underlining). Ideally, the titles will be linked to the work that is being referenced.

## Courtesy and Professional Titles

On first reference, introduce people by their first and last names without a courtesy title (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss, Ms., Sir, Madam, Dr.).

If a person's gender isn't clear from their first name (e.g., Chris, Pat, Lesley, Jean), make this clear by referring to them by the appropriate pronoun after the first reference.

## Content Titles and Headers

### Format
We use [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Title_case) for for all titles and paragraph headers. Only use end punctuation for headers that pose a question (e.g., What Did We Learn?). If you‚Äôre unsure, many free, web-based title case tools use the filters to get AP Style (Examples: [titlecase.com](http://www.titlecase.com) and [capitalizemytitle.com](http://www.capitalizemytitle.com)).

### Size
Article titles should be set to H1, with any subsequent headers set as H2, H3, and so forth, in hierarchical order.

Do not use H3 or below to attempt to make the text appear bold; just apply bold formatting to the text with the Formatting Toolbar in Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

## Numbers, Symbols, Dates, Time, and Places

### Numbers

- Write out all nine numbers under 10, except for percentages
- Use the word percent; not the percent sign)

### Symbols

Unless the symbol is part of a name or branding, use the word (e.g., use the word and instead of an ampersand & or plus sign +).

### Dates

- Use the expanded form of Month Day, Year (e.g., February 16, 2018) to avoid confusion that may arise by using the numeric format‚Äîfor users in some other countries, 01/11/2018 would mean November 1st; not January 11th.
  - For specific dates, use the full, four-digit year
- Can abbreviate for informal dates (the ‚Äò90s)
- Include ordinal indicators (st, nd, rd, th) on dates (e.g., use November 23rd instead of November 23)

### Time

- Time descriptors ‚Äúante meridiem‚Äù (before noon) and ‚Äúpost meridiem‚Äù (after noon) should be abbreviated with lowercase letters as am and pm, respectively.
- Use the 12-hour clock (8:00 am, 4:00 pm)
- Avoid redundancies, such as, "10 am this morning"
- Seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall, autumn) are not capitalized

### Places

- When referring to a number of states, the word ‚Äústate‚Äù should be lowercase (e.g., All 50 states responded.)
- Agency names (jump link to ‚ÄòAgency Abbreviations‚Äô below)
- Locations
  - District of Columbia: abbreviate as D.C. in copy, but use the official postal code, DC (without periods), for an address
  - United States: abbreviate as U.S.
  - In copy, spell out state names, such as California. This will help keep naming conventions consistent (while the 2-character abbreviation without periods is the current postal standard for addresses in U.S. states and territories, older versions are still used by some people), and it can help avoid confusion; people often mix up the abbreviation for Louisiana (LA) with the one for Los Angeles (L.A.)

## Agency Abbreviations

### Initialisms and Acronyms

To avoid confusion, always provide the full name of an agency or program the first time you mention it, followed by its abbreviation (an initialism or acronym) within parentheses. You can then use just the abbreviation elsewhere in the copy. Example:

> _Lorem ipsum **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)** dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat._
>
> _Duis aute irure dolor **NASA** in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum._

**Initialism examples**:

OMG, LOL, BIA, GSA, FBI, OPM, SEO, CMS, HTML, CSS

**Acronym (an initialism that is used as a word) examples**:

scuba, laser, radar, WYSIWYG, WCAG, NASA, OPEC, NARA, DARPA, INTERPOL, NATO, FEMA, SWAT

**_Note_**: Avoid redundancies, such as, ‚ÄúATM machine‚Äù (automated teller machine machine) and ‚ÄúPIN number‚Äù (personal identification number number).

### Pluralization
There is no need to add an _s_ to the end of an initialism or acronym if a word in the original name is already plural.

For example, we use **CoE** for _Centers of Excellence_. Adding an _s_ on the end‚ÄîCoEs‚Äîwould actually mean, _Centers of Excellences_.

## Punctuation

### Commas
In writing, oral pauses are indicated by commas. They are also used to order things, like lists, [clauses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49EsnvxVQec), or a series of terms. Much like debates over [what counts as a sandwich](https://twitter.com/matttomic/status/859117370455060481) and [the proper pronunciation for the image file type, _gif_](https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/22/tech/web/pronounce-gif/index.html), disagreements about whether or not to use an Oxford comma (also known as the _Harvard comma_ and the _serial comma_) are quite common.

It can be confusing (or potentially [costly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/16/the-ruling-in-this-maine-labor-dispute-hinged-on-the-omission-of-an-oxford-comma/) in [unexpected](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSTmAS2lZ_6/) ways) to omit the Oxford comma, so, we‚Äôd like to err on the side of caution. As noted by [AP Stylebook in their Twitter Chat on September 12, 2017](https://twitter.com/APStylebook/status/907673471865507841):

- ‚ÄúWe don't ban Oxford commas! We say: If omitting a comma could lead to confusion or misinterpretation, then use the comma.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúBut: If a comma doesn't help make clear what is being said, don't use it. "The flag is red, white and blue" is clear.‚Äù

So, use your best judgement. If anything is unclear, we‚Äôll help you clarify.

### Colons

After a colon, capitalize the next word if it starts a complete sentence (i.e., is not a [fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_clause_structure#Incomplete_sentence)).

### Apostrophe Abuse

Use an apostrophe to indicate:

- Possession‚Äî‚ÄùAgile also improves the development team‚Äôs ability to commit to work.‚Äù
- Missing letters or numbers
  - Contractions: ‚ÄùFor example, with a bilingual English/Spanish website, we would‚Äôve clearly labeled captions (for English text) and subtitles (for Spanish text).‚Äù
  - Date abbreviations: ‚Äùthe ‚Äò90s‚Äù (the apostrophe replaces the _19_ in _1990s_)

Do not use an apostrophe to make words plural.
Ever.
Ev. Er.
üòâ

### Em Dash

You can easily offset a phrase within a sentence with the long [em dash](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/why-you-should-love-the-em-dash/) ‚Äî instead of using parentheses, commas, colons, etc. (see link for examples).

### Lists (Bulleted, Numbered)

If it‚Äôs a complete sentence, use punctuation (usually a period) at the end of the list; not after every bullet point.

If it‚Äôs a list of fragments, do not use punctuation at the end. Capitalize the first word in each bullet point.

### i.e., vs. e.g.,

e.g. (_exempli gratia_), which is Latin for ‚Äúfor example, ...‚Äù use it to list one or more examples
i.e. (_id est_) is Latin for ‚Äúin other words, ...‚Äù
