## Image File Types



**Image Specs:**

At the moment, we prefer to be sent `.png` files.
All `.jpg` or `.jpeg` files will be converted to `.png` before we upload.

Please always send us the original image, as large as possible. Our content management system (CMS) will optimize and resize photos as necessary.

## Accessibility

All images require alt text and/or caption. Be descriptive, yet succinct. Take care to note if the image is an infographic, factoid, diagram, chart, photo, or logo. If related to a program, agency, or event, include the name and/or acronym (and if an event, please include the date).

## Attribution

**All** images require source information. Below are some examples of requirements based on source:

### Thinkstock.com photos
