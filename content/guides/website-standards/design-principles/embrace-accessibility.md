**Accessibility affects everybody, build it into every decision.** Legal requirements are a critical, necessary starting point, but this is only the beginning. Accessibility is about real people who use our services — it’s usability for people who interact with products differently. Everyone who works on government websites has a role to play in making federal resources accessible and inclusive. Design generously and celebrate accessibility requirements as a set of design constraints that help us create a better product for all users.
