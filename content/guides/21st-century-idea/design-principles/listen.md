**Evaluate and improve your product by listening to your audience and learning from what you hear.** Continuous feedback drives continuous improvement. Measure customer experience — how well what we’ve built is working for our audience — at every stage of a project, and as projects grow and mature. Listen to what people say and observe how they interact with our products or services, whether through direct observation or through analytics data. If we’re not listening, we’re not learning.
