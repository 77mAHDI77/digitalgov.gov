**Real user needs should inform product decisions.** Whether our audience includes members of the public or government employees, decision-makers must include real people in our design process from the beginning. Then, we need to test the assumptions we make and the products and services we build with real people, to keep us focused on what is most useful and important.


## Key considerations

-   Does your product or service have access to the resources necessary to perform research?
-   Who is your primary audience?
-   What user needs will this product or service address?
-   Do you use personas or other audience segment analysis techniques to connect your solutions to different segments of your audience?
-   How often are you testing with real people?
-   Which people will have the most difficulty with the product or service?
-   Which research methods were used?
-   What were the key findings?
-   How and where were the findings documented?
