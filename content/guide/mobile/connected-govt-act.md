The [Connected Government Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2331) (H.R.2331) was signed into law, in January of 2018, and requires new, and redesigned, agency websites to be mobile friendly. GSA and OMB will submit a report to Congress in 2019 that describes how agencies can implement the law and assesses their compliance.

The new law codifies the [Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf) (M-17-06).
