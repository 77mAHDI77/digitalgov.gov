The use of pop-ups is not necessarily bad on a desktop application. However, if the application uses responsive design or is used on a mobile application, pop-ups often obstruct and hurt the user experience. They draw the user's attention away from the page to the pop-up, and the novice user quickly becomes confused and frustrated.

## Pop-ups

**Issue** - Pop-up windows are not supported on many mobile devices and using them can have unpredictable results

**Solution** - There are many alternatives to pop-ups that are visible without taking up the entire window, such as lightboxes, inline expansion, and stationary banner ads.
