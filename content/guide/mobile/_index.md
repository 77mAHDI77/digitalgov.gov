In 2017, we tested the 26 U.S. federal websites most-visited by mobile devices _(smartphones and tablets)_, from 9/22/2017 to 3/22/2017, using seven mobile-friendly automated test tools. We found these five practices prevented these sites from being as mobile-friendly as a user might expect or want.

Most of these problems happen during the siteâ€™s creation and lead to poor performance. For more information on how we conducted the tests, see the full methodology [LINK].
