## Participating in the Program

Any federal agency can sign up to use the common Web analytics tool. Here&#8217;s how it works:

  * Agencies define a DAP point of contact.
  * GSA will send the agency point of contact a short, sign-up form to register their agency and work with them to implement the common page tag code.
  * GSA will provide implementation support, access to training, and other resources to agency points of contact.
  * If you don&#8217;t have an identified point of contact, [send us an email](mailto:dap@support.digitalgov.gov).

## Gaining Access to the Dashboard

If your agency participates in the program, you can request access to the data by [emailing us](mailto:dap@support.digitalgov.gov). We&#8217;ll send you instructions and a short registration form, and notify your agency POC. After you complete the form, we&#8217;ll grant you access and get you started!
