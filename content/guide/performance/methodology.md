Here are the methods we followed the following steps to conduct this study:

1. Using DAP statistics, we pulled the names of the top 26 U.S. federal government websites accessed by mobile devices.
2. We tested each site using  seven mobile-friendly automated test tools:
  - Google Mobile Friendly Test - https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/
  - Mobile Moxie - https://www.mobilemoxie.com/tools/site_analysis/
  - Mobi Ready - http://ready.mobi/
  - Page Insights - https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/
  - W3C MobileOK Checker - https://validator.w3.org/mobile/
  - Varvy SEO tool - https://varvy.com/
  - Gtmetrix - https://gtmetrix.com/
3. After looking at the failed criteria reported by each tool, we compiled the results into a single Excel sheet.
4. We grouped the issues that we found on 15 or more sites into the five categories covered in this article, which are listed in order of most occurrences (JavaScript) to least occurrences (pop-ups).
