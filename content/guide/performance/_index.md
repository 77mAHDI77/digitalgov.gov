JavaScript usage, CSS usage, image and resource sizing, caching/network usage, and pop-ups. These are the top five practices that the most visited government websites should focus on in order to be more mobile-friendly. But how can you work on each of these areas to help ensure your website keeps mobile users delighted and coming back?

For six months, from September 22, 2017 to March 22, 2018, we tested the 26 U.S. federal government websites most visited by mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) using seven mobile-friendly automated test tools. The results indicated that these were the common practices that make these sites not as mobile-friendly as a user might expect or want in a mobile experience. Most of these areas do not directly relate to usability issues, but instead concern how the site is built that leads to poor performance (for more information on how we conducted the tests, see the full Methodology section in the guideâ€™s navigation menu below).

The information here outlines the top five practices we found across these sites. The most common issue found on these sites involves the use of JavaScript. JavaScript is used on many desktop and mobile applications because it extends the functionality of web pages, is a relatively easy language to learn and use, and it executes relatively quickly on the client side. However, if JavaScript is not placed and executed from an optimal place in the code, not minimized, nor used inline, it may negatively affect the application performance on mobile devices that traditionally have minimal resources.

Keep in mind, if a website is developed using a content management system (CMS) or development framework, not all of these settings may be configurable. However, we suggest that developers research the capabilities of the system to determine if they can be. Some of these recommendations may occur in the web server layer, which may be separate from the program code.
