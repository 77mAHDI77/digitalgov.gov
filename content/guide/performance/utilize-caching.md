You can do this in two ways: local caching or minimizing the use of external scripts and objects.

## Leverage Browser Caching

**Issue** - Fetching resources over the network is both slow and expensive and the download may require multiple roundtrips between the client and server, which delays processing and may block rendering of page content. This can also incur data costs for the visitor. All server responses should specify a caching policy to help the client determine if and when they can reuse a previously fetched response.

**Solution** - Leverage browser caching by changing the request headers of your resources to use caching. You can either add some code to the “.htaccess” configuration file on the web host/server or use the basic Cache-Control HTTP header (see below).

```
Cache-Control: max-age=2592000, public
```

## Combine Multiple Files For Improved Performance

**Issue** - Every external object downloaded on a page requires a separate DNS request. This is not a big problem on a traditional computer with a fast connection, but on slower mobile networks it can cause latency. This will hurt application performance and load time.

**Solution** - Reduce the number and size of resources required for the site. However, if that is not possible, combine all external CSS files into a single style sheet or all JavaScript files into one big file to reduce the number of calls to the browser.
