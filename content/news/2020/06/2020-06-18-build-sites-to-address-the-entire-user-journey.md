Welcome to [This Week’s IDEA](https://digital.gov/topics/this-weeks-idea/), where we talk about one essential topic around [21st Century IDEA](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) and share resources and tools that you can use to start making small, incremental changes to your websites and digital services.

One of the design principles of the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) (USWDS) is promoting [continuity](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/#promote-continuity), or minimizing disruption, for your customers over time and across platforms, agencies, and devices.

Agencies, websites, and services all have different audiences, goals and missions and the way we all implement them differ. One way to mitigate these challenges is to design sites with the USWDS in mind, and build sites with user-centered solutions to address the entire user journey, not just a specific task. One way you can do this is through [journey mapping](https://methods.18f.gov/decide/journey-mapping/).

Below, we cover how journey maps provide value to your project and how you can use them even when the people you need to work with are geographically distributed.

## What are journey maps?

Journey maps are artifacts that display how one person goes through a process, which could be as common and everyday as making a cup of coffee, or important and infrequent as applying for a passport. They range from as few as two steps on a path, to as many are needed to adequately make the journey understandable. Each mapped step of a journey can describe goals, interactions, materials required, and even thoughts or emotional states

## Why use a journey map?

It's rare for an agency to have control over how a customer experiences a service from start to finish. Creating journey maps can help you see how your customer experiences the full service - before and after they interact with your piece of the puzzle. The process and resulting map can reinforce empathy skills, like walking in someone else’s shoes, that helps you understand the customer mindset as they enter and exit each step.

Journey mapping as a process can help your team think strategically about work, prioritize, and gain alignment on shared goals. Journey maps help ask “Why?” in a focused way, e.g.:

-   Why are we doing ____?
    
-   Why are we not doing ____?
    
-   Why are we doing ____ the way we’re doing it?
    

## How to journey map

The major steps of journey mapping are:

1.  Align on the purpose of your journey mapping
    
2.  Select a process to map
    
3.  Identify phases and steps of the process (it’s critical to get customers’ or users’ perspective here)
    
4.  Select and visualize the attributes of each step
    
5.  Analyze the map to find patterns or opportunities for improvement
    

## When you have a distributed team

When your team is distributed or cannot be together in person, you can condense this process by structuring your meeting in three steps:

1.  Align on the journey mapping purpose and determine what to map
    
2.  Break the process down and visualize it
    
3.  Analyze the map to find patterns or opportunities for improvement
    

## Before you collaborate remotely

For a seasoned facilitator and experienced researcher adjusting to remote synchronous collaboration may be the most challenging part. Gauge the participants’ familiarity with synchronous remote collaboration and with activities like journey mapping in order to decide how to orchestrate the session.

### What helpers do you need?

In advance, ask someone to be the moderator. While you guide the discussion and share your screen with the group, the moderator can keep an eye on the chat, assist anyone having a technical issue, and call your attention to someone who has something to say. Will you be making notes on your shared screen while you facilitate, or would you like a scribe to do the typing/drawing?

### Select the tools you’ll use

Tools can range from pen and paper to spreadsheets to concept-mapping software like Mural, Miro, or slide deck tools. The tools you use should prioritize collaboration over complexity. A high-fidelity version of the journey map will come later. When selecting the right tool consider:

-   Which tool are you most confident using?
    
-   Do you want everyone to easily work together in the document?
    
-   Is the team learning new tools or the journey mapping process on their own without a facilitator?
    

### Tech check: test your tools

Test out your setup with the moderator. Tell participants in advance what tools you’ll be using and make sure that everyone will be able to participate equally. You might suggest they have pen and paper handy so you can ask them to write thoughts down during the session. If this type of collaboration is very new for team members, schedule a 30-minute drop-in session for people to try out whatever you will be using.

### Set the ground rules

At the beginning of each session, tell people how and when they can contribute, e.g.:

-   “Stay muted and unmute yourself to speak any time” -or- “Type ‘Comment’ in the chat and the moderator will call on people”
    
-   “Go ahead and write in the shared document as we go” -or- “The scribe and I will be taking notes on-screen as we go. If we don’t capture your intent, please let us know!”
