title: 2020 in Review: A Governmentwide Window To Public Experience
deck: "**2020 in Review: A Governmentwide Window To Public Experience**&mdash;Search.gov recently released a report looking at federal search traffic during 2020. Between the COVID-19 pandemic, social unrest, and environmental emergencies, 2020 was truly an extraordinary year. The COVID-19 pandemic changed search patterns and volume significantly. Some topics saw as high as a 500% increase in volume, while others dropped 90%. Forms, usually one of the top needs, saw a steady level of demand but still dropped to 5th place in 2020 due to other emergent needs."
