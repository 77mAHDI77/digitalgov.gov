Are you interested in rebalancing grants compliance efforts with a focus on results for the American taxpayer? Would you like to see more standardization in grants reporting and an improvement in data collection for grants? 

If so, Join our community!

## Who we are

Our community consist of grants managers from federal, state, and local government, tribes, researchers, non-profits, and academia, who steward over $700 billion in grants funding through more than 1,800 diverse federal grants programs. We engage public-private stakeholders to develop best practices that modernized grants management and balance compliance requirements with results. 

## What we do

Federal grants touch every aspect of the American economy. From funding research, to advancing education, housing and infrastructure programs, federal grants stimulate growth that moves the nation forward! 

Our community engages stakeholders around the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/) (PMA), and the [Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_8.html). We are committed to rebalancing compliance efforts with a focus on results for the American taxpayer; standardizing grant reporting data and improving data collection in ways that will increase efficiency and promote evaluation, while reducing reporting burden. 

We host a Listserv for members to join the discussion, ask questions, and propose innovative opportunities that support the broader mission to modernize current grants management practices.
