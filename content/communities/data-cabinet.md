### Data Value Proposition

The value of data lies in the Agencies ability to use it. Raw data adds value as it moves up the pyramid to become the cornerstone of high-level, high value decisions by leadership.

Valuable Data comes from three pillars:

- Data Management -> leads to high quality data
- Data Governance -> ensures the entire agency understands the value and handling of data
- Data in Action ->  strategic  Value derived from the agencies efforts

In order to advance data culture, we are built on five principals:

- Drive Decisions
- Foster Collaboration
- Inform and Engage the Public
- Increase Capabilities
- Facilitate Product and Service Developments

By combining these pillars and guiding principles, we can empower individuals across government to operationalize data to make informed decisions, maximize the use and ROI of data, and identify options and opportunities for modernizing Government through data-driven problem solving.
