## Introduction

The robotic process automation (RPA) CoP exists to bring together federal agencies that are interested in implementing RPA into their respective agencies. The CoP will share information and resources on the RPA process, collaborate and problem solve. This CoP is organized and coordinated by the General Services Administration (GSA).

## What we do

The CoP achieves its mission through information sharing, identification and definition of options, best practices, methods and standards for RPA implementation and operations.  The CoP does not set policy, but policy-setting agencies are encouraged to participate and make use of the community’s base of knowledge, information and experience.  

## Who we are 

The executive sponsors of the RPA CoP are GSA Chief Financial Officer Gerard Badorrek and GSA Technology Transformation Services (TTS) Director Anil Cheriyan. The CoP will be chaired by Ed Burrows of the GSA Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).

## Topic areas 

The CoP is organized by Practice Areas for distinct components of RPA program management. Each Practice Area is led by a volunteer agency employee - a Practice Leader - and supported by Practice Area Team - a group of agency volunteers.  All members are required to join at least one Practice Area Team after their first meeting attended. This reflects the CoP’s principle that all contribute and all benefit. The following is an initial, proposed list of Practice Areas and will be amended as agreed by the CoP:

#### Program and Operations Management
  - Governance / Center of Excellence (including strategies for scaling)
  - Human Resource Impacts, Culture Change, Communications (internal and external)
  - Business Case (including benefit realization)
  - Operations Management (modify and fix bots)
  - Management Reporting (performance metrics, dashboarding)
  - Contracting

#### Process Assessment and Implementation
  - Identification, Assessment and Selection of Processes for Automation
  - Implementation Process (including documentation, templates, and audit readiness)
  - Development (including documentation, templates and audit readiness)
  - Use Cases, including potential government-wide cases and identification of bots and bot components to be included in the ‘Asset LIbrary’ (reusable code)
  - Bot Scope (guidelines for human vs. bot functions, privacy, ethics)

#### Technical
  - IT Platform, including configuration and capacity management (options and best practice)
  - Bot Credentialing (options and best practices)
  - Security(ATO)
  - Privacy [Privacy Threshold Assessment (PTA), Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA), System of Records Notices (SORN)]
  - Software Options and Capabilities
  - Platform for Government-wide Sharing of Bots and Bot Components (‘Asset Library’)
  - Evolution / Combination of RPA with Cognitive Technologies
