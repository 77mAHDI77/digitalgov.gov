## Purpose

The RPA Community of Practice (CoP) helps individual agencies overcome the technical, management, and operational challenges that arise in designing and deploying an effective RPA program. This includes important initiatives like designing common federal standards for credentialing, ensuring privacy and security, and designing common management metrics to gauge RPAâ€™s government-wide impact.

## What We Do

The CoP helps agencies convert RPA enthusiasm into action. Specifically, the CoP helps agencies develop programs that are cost-effective and auditable, avoid common pitfalls, and make a significant impact. The CoP hosts frequent knowledge-sharing events and publishes valuable guidance on best practices.

## Who We Are

The RPA CoP comprises  leaders across the federal government who share a passion for RPA.
