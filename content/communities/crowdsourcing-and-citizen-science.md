### Overview 
The CCS seeks to expand and improve the U.S. government’s use of crowdsourcing, citizen science, and similar public participation techniques for the purpose of enhancing agency mission, scientific, and societal outcomes. The CCS seeks to create a nurturing ecosystem for federally supported services, the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines, and sciences that draw on public participation and partnership. 

### Who we are 
The community is open to all federal practitioners working on, funding, or just interested in learning more about crowdsourcing and citizen science.

### What we do
The community meets on the last Thursday of every month from 2:30 – 4:30 pm E.T., hosted by member agencies. The community also shares resources and discusses specific topics of interest via conversations on the listserv.
