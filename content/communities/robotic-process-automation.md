The Federal RPA Community of Practice (CoP) is a thought leadership and collaborative body designed to rapidly accelerate the adoption of RPA technology across the federal government.

This community consists of representatives from more than 50 Federal agencies, with more than 750 confirmed members.

The executive sponsors for the RPA Community of Practice are GSA Chief Financial Officer and acting CoP Chair, Gerard Badorrek, and GSA Technology Transformation Services (TTS) Director, Anil Cheriyan.

## Our Mission

The RPA CoP pursues a bifurcated mission. First, the organization is charged with designing solutions to overcome the technological, management, and operational challenges that organizations can encounter in designing and deploying an effective RPA program. This portion of the mission includes important initiatives like designing common federal standards for credentialing, privacy, and security, and designing common management metrics to gauge government-wide impact of RPA.

The second element of our mission is to provide knowledge sharing and mentoring to organizations looking to start an RPA program or to evolve their current RPA services. This RPA Playbook is a small part of the CoP’s knowledge sharing efforts, which also include frequent cross-government collaborative meetings, communications, thought leadership pieces, webinars, and workshops.

The RPA CoP seeks to achieve its important mission with a sense of urgency and a bias towards action. As agencies continue to learn the potential benefits of RPA, enthusiasm for developing RPA programs government-wide grows exponentially. The RPA CoP plays an important role in helping agencies convert RPA enthusiasm into action. Specifically, the CoP helps agencies develop programs that are cost effective, auditable, avoid common pitfalls, and most importantly, deploy impactful automations.

## What We Do

The community achieves its mission through information sharing, identification and definition of options, best practices, methods and standards for RPA implementation and operations. It does not set policy, but policy-setting agencies are encouraged to participate and make use of the community’s base of knowledge, information, and experience.
