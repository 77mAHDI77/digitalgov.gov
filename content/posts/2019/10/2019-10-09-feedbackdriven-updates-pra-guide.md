title: "Feedback-Driven Updates to the PRA Guide"
deck: "This week, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), who oversee the Guide to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), **made some user-centered updates to clarify the PRA process for information collections associated with proposed rules**. These changes include an easy to understand chart that lays out the steps for this sometimes hard to understand process, and are a direct result of the feedback they’ve been getting from the community."
