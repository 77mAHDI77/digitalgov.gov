Across the federal government, Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) are helping with streamlining regulations, increasing engagement with private sector investors, and deploying pioneering machine learning and natural language processing solutions across the federal government. 

As part of the President's Management Agenda (PMA), PIFs are working on the [Cross Agency Priority](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html) (CAP) Goal number 4 on governmentwide Customer Experience (CX). This work—across 24 federal agencies—is to design the data infrastructure necessary to create the first public-facing dashboards on citizen experience. At the Department of Transportation, they are helping unlock the potential of AI and autonomous systems while designing for a future transportation ecosystem.

We’ve seen several of our fellows get awards and recognition, such as the 2019 Service to the Citizen Award, the Fed 100, and the DCFemTech award—which a PIF received for their work in data and design. We’ve seen a PIF promoted to a leadership position in the [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/) (CoE) within the [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS), helping usher in a future of federal leadership with human-centered design. And just last week, one of our fellows, was named to be the Director of Artificial Intelligence at the  [VA Office of Research and Development](https://www.research.va.gov/).

To understand agencies, our fellows have traveled across the nation to solve regional technology challenges, and globally to Prague to meet with stakeholders at the front lines of global media. From San Diego to South Carolina, fellows have visited national labs, hospitals, call centers, and claim processing centers for a holistic view of end-to-end business lines and operations. Along the way, they’ve even been to [NASA Wallops](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/wallops/home/) to watch the launch of a spacecraft. 

The PIF journey is a tested one. For seven years, fellows have been catalysts in American innovation. We are now creating tools to quantify the impact of innovation. At the program level, we have piloted an interactive Storybank that allows our fellows to capture internal learnings about their work. Similar to a weekly diary, the learnings are giving us better insight into some of the advances, blockers, and collaborations happening across 24 agencies.


Take a look at what our fellows have been working on:

**GIL ALTEROVITZ **

At the National Cancer Institute of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Gil is incentivizing government and industry AI-able data linkages through Health Tech Sprint and providing AI thought leadership to White House.

**STEVEN BABITCH**

Steven is codifying how the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) engages industry, including on information sharing. He is advising on the approach related to a policy matter, and working with mission support and operational divisions on the mitigation of national security threats.

**NINA BIANCHI**

From clinical trials and data supply chains to artificial intelligence and management operations, she is ushering in the future of federal leadership by design.

**CLARICE CHAN**

At the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Clarice is focused on modernizing how the VA communicates and delivers services to Veterans. Bringing design thinking and inclusive design to build better user-experiences that meet Veterans where they are, not where we are.

**MARIA LYNNE DAYTON** 

As part of the President’s Management Agenda (the Cross Agency Priority Goal number 4 on government wide Customer Experience), Maria streamlined the regulations and built the first 26 agency public facing dashboards on citizen experience. She also helped launch the first compliant interagency surveying tool called Touchpoints. 

**ALI DIALLO**

At the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Ali is supporting a claim automation initiative that will help families of Veterans get burial benefits faster and more efficiently.

**GEORGETA DRAGOIU**

At the National Institutes of Health, Georgeta is developing data-driven communications and marketing strategies for the All of Us Research program, whose goal is to tailor medical treatments for individual needs. 

**ADAM DRAKE**

Is the first PIF to work with any of the military services and is currently helping the Marine Corps and Department of Defense with a variety of technology modernization and machine learning/applied AI efforts. In addition to the Marine Corps, Adam has also supported the Department of the Navy, the Defense Innovation Board, Army Futures Command, Defense Digital Services, and the Air Force.
