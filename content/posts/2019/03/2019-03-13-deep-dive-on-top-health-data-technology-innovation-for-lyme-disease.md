Eleven teams in The Opportunity Project (TOP) Health sprint—a 14-week technology sprint—showcased their outcomes at an “[Artificial Intelligence and Open Data Innovation for Health](/pdf/AI-Open-Data-Innovation-infographic.pdf)” event at the White House Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB) on February 28, 2019 ([see agenda](/pdf/AI-Open-Data-Innovation-agenda.pdf)). The following day select teams presented on the main stage of [TOP Demo Day 2019](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2019/opportunity-project.html), where all teams demonstrated their digital tools at the U.S. Census Bureau ([see agenda](/pdf/TOP-Demo-Day-agenda-2019-03-01.pdf)). These two days unveiled how industry teams and innovators participated in the TOP Health tech sprint in order to create new digital tools and real-world value from federal open data, available on [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov) and [HealthData.gov](https://www.healthdata.gov).

Back in October 2018, when the [TOP Health tech sprint began](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/blog/2018/09/21/announcing-a-top-tech-sprint-for-health-innovation-join-us.html), we welcomed problem-solvers from all walks of life to join us. When different groups connect and diverse disciplines cross-pollinate, new insights often arise. Ideas and innovations can stem from unexpected places.

To quote Alan Turing, “**_Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do the things no one can imagine._**”

## K-12 STEM Innovation

What we couldn’t imagine was that K-12 STEM innovators would join our TOP Health sprint—and dazzle the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program, and leadership from across federal government. “These young people were very impressive,” said Ed Simcox, HHS Chief Technology Officer, “When it comes to a ‘wicked problem’ such as Lyme disease, we want to encourage innovation from any source, and clearly young people are stepping up to the challenge.”

This next generation of technologists and innovators included a 14-year-old girl, Olivia Goodreau, from Colorado. Olivia was one of our young TOP Health innovators, but not the youngest. Her brothers, 11-year-old twins, Jack and Will Goodreau, also participated in the TOP Health sprint. From Ohio, the Stauffer family, with siblings Anna, Benjamin, and Noah—ages 15, 14, and 12, respectively—contributed. Of the four teams that satisfied TOP Health criteria and delivered digital tools for Lyme and tick-borne diseases, two teams were led by middle school students in STEM. These young innovators developed:

The TickTracker App, which you can download today for free on Android and Apple devices, uses real-time geolocation and amalgamates data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Smithsonian Institute, other federal agencies, and non-government data. The LivLyme Foundation created the TickTracker app and used the TOP Health sprint to connect with government data stewards and unlock new datasets to improve the app with new functionality. At the end of the TOP Health sprint, the TickTracker App went live with new data visualizations and heat maps to show the distributions of ticks.

The TickTickBoom! Game by the LivLyme Foundation is the first-ever gamification tool for middle school children to learn how to protect themselves from ticks that may spread diseases like Lyme disease. The TickTickBOOM! game will soon be available for free to download on Android and Apple devices. As the twin inventors, Will and Jack Goodreau said in unison, “Who doesn’t want to blow up ticks?”

## TOP Health Challenges

The TOP Health sprint featured two challenges, one on AI for clinical trials and one on Lyme and tick-borne diseases. [Read about the TOP Health Challenge #1 results on AI](https://digital.gov/2019/02/27/how-a-health-tech-sprint-inspired-an-ai-ecosystem/) in part one of this two-part “Deep Dive” blog series. Both challenges connected federal datasets and data stewards with emerging technologies and ideas and from highly motivated, non-government innovators to solve real-world challenges. Each TOP Health team and its digital tool had to:

1. **Use government data** by incorporating or referencing any one (or more) of the 300,000+ datasets and resources on [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov) and [HealthData.gov](https://www.healthdata.gov).
2. **Involve “users”** by engaging with patients, practitioners, and/or other stakeholders in the creation of the digital tool (e.g., user-centered methodologies and iterations).
3. **Launch a new tool or add new features or functionality** during the approximately 3-month duration of the TOP Health tech sprint.

The TOP Health Challenge #2 asked: “**How can we address Lyme and tick-borne disease through emerging technologies by coupling the power of the crowd and patient insights with data?**”

### Why Lyme Disease?

Lyme disease, a tick-borne bacterial infection, is a public health priority infecting over 300,000 people in the United States each year. Domestically, it is a common vector-borne disease and the problem is growing in magnitude and geographic region. Societal costs of Lyme disease diagnostic testing—just testing for the disease, not treatment—are estimated at $492 million each year in the United States. Treatment costs are undoubtedly more with estimates in the billions, yet additional research is needed to fully characterize the economic and social costs of Lyme and tick-borne diseases.

The HHS Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) is working at the intersection of data, innovation, emerging technologies, and public-private collaborations to catalyze new solutions with the CDC, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other HHS offices. This TOP Health sprint fits within the broader “[Lyme Innovation](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/blog/2018/11/20/the-hhs-office-of-the-cto-announces-a-lyme-innovation-initiative.html)” initiative of the HHS Office of the CTO, which aims to co-create the next generation of tick-borne disease solutions with patients and practitioners as partners. Specifically for this TOP Health Challenge #2 on Lyme and tick-borne diseases, we encouraged the teams to explore any and all ideas—as long as they met the three eligibility criteria given above. Below are summaries of the four Lyme disease teams, each of which met the TOP Health criteria and delivered new digital tools or functionality between October 2018 and January 2019.

1. **LivLyme Foundation** _TickTracker App_ — Denver, CO and Columbus, OH <br />TickTracker is a free global app created by a 13-year-old girl who started the LivLyme Foundation. This app lets users track and report ticks in real-time using geolocation so that people in the United States and around the world can stay safe.
2. **LivLyme Foundation** _TickTracker App_ — Denver, CO and Columbus, OH <br />TickTockBOOM! game is a free mobile app created by 11-year-old twins. It is an edutainment (education entertainment)-based game targeted towards teaching our nation's youth about tick awareness and, ultimately, tick bite prevention.
3. **California Center for Functional Medicine** _Clyme Health_ — San Francisco Bay Area, California <br />The Clyme Health app organizes data-gathering and data visualization for patients with complex, chronic conditions so that care providers and researchers can better measure the efficacy of treatments and, together identify data-driven solutions with personalized medicine.
4. **TrialX and Global Lyme Alliance** _Lyme Tracker App_ — New York, NY <br />Tracking Lyme disease symptoms is critical for people living with Lyme disease; patients and physicians rely on this data to understand disease progression and manage individual symptoms. The Lyme Tracker App will enable patients to easily track symptoms or physical activity so as to provide ongoing data to further advance clinical research in this space.

**The Clyme Health App** provides patient symptom tracking for Lyme disease, inspired by NIH Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) data. The Clyme Health tool (originally called “LymeDot”) began as an idea at a [Lyme Innovation Hackathon](http://lymeinnovation.org/2016-in-review/) in 2016 that was co-sponsored by the Bay Area Lyme Foundation, MIT Hacking Medicine, and Harvard University’s Dean Center for Tick-Borne Illness. After gaining recognition in the 2016 – 2017 Lyme Innovation Hackathons, the app was renamed “Clyme Health” and acquired by the California Center for Functional Medicine (CCFM). During the TOP Health sprint, CCFM finished the technical development for the Clyme Health app and linked it to electronic health records (EHRs) for patient and practitioner use. In the words of Dr. Sunjya Schweig, Co-Director of CCFM and the Clyme Health team lead:

> “Clyme Health is a new ecosystem for managing Lyme and chronic illness patients, one that is both high-tech and high touch. It leverages symptom tracking, wearable data, easy access for patients to their own data with [Blue Button 2.0](https://bluebutton.cms.gov/) interoperability, and marries this with support and coaching to help patients navigate their chronic illness and path to recovery. Our goal is to help patients find treatments that work, help doctors better care for their complex patients, and help researchers identify diagnostic and treatment insights that will help the community at large.”

**Lyme Symptom Tracker App** by the Global Lyme Alliance (GLA) and TrialX launched for public use at the end of the TOP Health sprint. Similar to the Clyme Health App, this app aims to help people with Lyme disease track their symptoms and share their data with their healthcare providers. The GLA and TrialX app integrates with TrialX’s iConnect platform, which empowers people to find and connect with a clinical trial investigator or clinical trials near them. Sara Tyghter, GLA Director of Education and Outreach and co-facilitator of the app development in TOP Health, said:

> “There is a critical need to take a patient-centric approach to gather population-level data in order to better understand the traits of Lyme disease. Furthermore, such amassed patient data is important to share in an open environment that will give scientists and physicians a means to accelerate their research efforts and ultimately help patients.”

The **Clyme Health** and **Lyme Symptom Tracker** apps are not connected, although both tools rest on [Blue Button 2.0](https://bluebutton.cms.gov/) standards for data interoperability and portability. These types of tools quantify symptoms and wellness over time, while empowering patients with easy access to their own health data. Patients then choose if and how to share their health data with practitioners, researchers, or third parties.

Digital tools like those developed through the TOP Health sprint, can empower patients to document their experiences with quantitative data points. Individual anecdotes, over time, become big data. Eventually, these data may yield new insights on complex conditions that can inform action.

## Co-Creating Solutions and Next Steps

None of these TOP Health digital tools will solve today’s Lyme disease challenges, as scientific discovery and research are designed to provide answers yet progress takes time. Understanding Lyme disease to protect public health and improve patient outcomes is a long-term mission. It will take all of us, contributing however we can. To assist the research mission, TOP Health engaged new audiences in the near-term of weeks and months to explore how tick-borne diseases may be addressed through the trifecta of data + technology + innovation.

TOP Health demonstrated the value of interdisciplinary teams across sectors—government, industry, philanthropy, non-profit organizations, academia, and K-12 STEM education. There is collective power when diverse groups come together to ideate, test concepts, and rapidly iterate on data-driven prototypes. Participating teams forged new collaborations, strengthened existing relationships, and learned from each other. These collaborations continue today, even beyond the end of the TOP Health sprint. Without ongoing HHS involvement, the TOP Health teams continue to develop and enhance their digital tools showcased at the White House EEOB and the Census Bureau.

One theme that emerged from showcasing TOP Health results is how listening to patients and people is where problem solving begins. Transformative change happens because of people, processes, and technologies—in that order.

The TOP Health process reaffirmed the commitment of the HHS Office of the CTO to co-create solutions with patients and practitioners as partners. We must open our doors and our minds to hear candid feedback from individual stakeholders including patients, advocates, providers, and researchers.
