Welcome to this week’s idea, where we explain one essential topic around [**21st Century IDEA**](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) and give you the resources and tools to start making focused changes to your digital products.

This week, we’d like to talk about [trust](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trust), and the key elements that go into building that trust with people who are using our services.

Those who oversee federal websites and digital services can't assume that trust is a given. Trust is earned each time someone has a positive experience with your service. And building trust takes time, and involves understanding (then meeting or exceeding) a user’s expectations—a process that can be established quickly and maintained over continued interactions. And that trust is easily damaged.

The more we do this work, it becomes clear that trust is a key value that overlays why we do this work. And it’s our job as civil servants, to build the elements that earn the public’s trust.

**Help us identify a trustworthy experience**

We’d like to get your help in defining the elements that we all need to have in place to start earning trust, and what actions federal digital teams need to take to get there.
