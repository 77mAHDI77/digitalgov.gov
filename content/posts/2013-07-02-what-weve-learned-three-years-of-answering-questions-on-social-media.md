In January 2010, we began to respond to questions and comments on our [Facebook](({{< relref "social-media-metrics-for-federal-agencies-2.md" >}})). We use a Google Form to record every question, the team member who answered it, the channel, and how long it took. This allows us to identify questions for the cheat sheet and show ROI to management. We’ve learned other important lessons over the years, such as:

  * Keep a cheat sheet of the most frequent questions and the answers. This will ensure continuity among the team and save time.
  * Know when to ask for help. Ask the team if you’ve spent more than 5 minutes looking for an answer. More heads are always better than one.
  * Keep your social media guidelines up-to-date and train your team. Our [editorial guidelines](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2013/07/socmed_editorial_guidelines_010411.pdf) (PDF) discuss important points like voice and tone to keep answers consistent.
  * Adjust based on metrics. Collect metrics that can help you improve.
