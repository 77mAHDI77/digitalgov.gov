[Last year Google began changing their search ranking algorithm](({{< relref "trends-on-tuesday-google-to-implement-mobile-friendly-rankings.md" >}})) to direct mobile users to mobile-friendly sites, and they recently announced that beginning in [May they will be implementing an update to focus even more exclusively on boosting mobile-friendly sites](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/03/continuing-to-make-web-more-mobile.html).

In the announcement, Google encourages website owners to test their sites using the [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/) and [Webmaster Mobile Guide](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/), to learn how to improve your site for mobile friendliness.

One new solution Google is pushing for sites to move more mobile-friendly the new [AMP mobile framework](({{< relref "the-content-corner-facebook-expands-access-to-instant-articles.md" >}}))” performance platform and to help improve the mobile experience for people using mobile devices, where performance can sometimes be lacking due to cellular network latency and device memory limitations.
