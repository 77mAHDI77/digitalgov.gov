NASA recently announced the winners of a [smartwatch app interface competition](http://fedscoop.com/nasa-names-winner-in-smartwatch-app-design-contest). A Canadian duo won the design competition, and NASA’s plan is to build the app with 2016 funding to have it [available for astronauts to use](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/NASA-Challenge-Astronaut-Smartwatch-App-Interface-Design-261634.html) when they are aboard the International Space Station.

This is the first government smartwatch app development we’ve talked about on DigitalGov and an example of a great [mobile moment](({{< relref "is-your-agency-winning-its-mobile-moments.md" >}})) use case. Not only is the smart app interesting (({{< relref "how-six-agencies-are-crowdsourcing-with-mobile-apps.md" >}})) and [crowdsourcing their actual mobile development](({{< relref "nist-hosts-reference-data-challenge-to-create-mobile-apps.md" >}})), none have publicly crowdsourced just the app design.

While development of native apps requires [easily consumable data]({{< relref "internet-of-things.md" >}}), new approaches to anywhere, anytime development like this are going to be imperative.

_Looking for ideas on how to craft a successful crowdsourcing project? The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Federal Community of Practice on Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science [recently released a Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing Toolkit](({{< relref "how-ostp-crowdsourced-a-crowdsourcing-toolkit.md" >}})) to help agencies open up innovation in government. The toolkit contains information, resources, and best practices federal agencies can use to harness the power of public participation._
