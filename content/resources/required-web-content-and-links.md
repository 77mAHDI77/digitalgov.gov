If you manage a public website in the federal executive branch, you are required to have certain content&mdash;or provide links to content&mdash;from specific places on "your agency’s principal website and on any known sub-agency or other major entry points to their site".

Here is the law:

{{< law src="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf" name="**OMB M-17-06**: Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services" pdf="(PDF, 1.2 MB, 18 pages, November 2016)" >}}
**16. Ensure Access to Mandatory Content**

Laws, regulations, or other policies will occasionally mandate that agencies place certain links on their website. Agencies must respect and adhere to these statutory or executive-level mandates and incorporate these requirements in a manner that does not reduce the usability or performance of the agency’s website and digital services.

At a minimum, {{< highlight >}}agencies must post links to the following information on the agency’s principal website and on any known sub-agency or other major entry points to their site{{< /highlight >}}:

- **A.** USA.gov;
- **B.** the website’s privacy policy;
- **C.** the agency’s Freedom of Information Act webpage;
- **D.** a page about the agency with descriptions of the agency organization structure, mission, and statutory authority, and links to the following information:
	1. the agency’s strategic plan and annual performance plans;
	2. the agency’s Privacy Program Page;
	3. the agency point of contact as required by the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002
	4. the agency’s Open Government Page;
	5. the agency’s Plain Writing Page;
	6. information as required under the No Fear Act of 2002;
	7. information associated with the agency’s implementation of the Information Quality Act.

For other required links, Federal agencies should determine the best location on their website to place those links based on user needs and the underlying requirement from law or policy.{{< /law >}}

_&#42; These requirements apply to executive departments and agencies and their public websites. Check the specific law to see if it also applies to the judicial or legislative agencies, or to intranets._

_**The Federal Web Managers Council** recommends that government agencies use consistent link labels for common content found on government websites. These recommendations are based on industry standard link labels and a usability study of common government terms [usability study of common government terms](http://www.slideshare.net/DigitalGov/icgi-content-standards-usability-test-results "ICGI Content Standards: Usability Test Results, Content Managers’ Forum, July 15, 2004") (MS PowerPoint, 144 KB, 49 slides, July 2004)._
