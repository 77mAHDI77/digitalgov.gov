- the text that you should use for each link
- where the link should be located on your site
- which law requires those links

In addition to being compliant with the law, it is recommended that agencies implement these user-friendly required links with in clear, user-friendly way.

For specific implementation guidance, see the [**U.S. Web Design System Footer** component](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/footer/), as this is where most of these links should be located on your site.

## Equal Employment
All federal public websites must comply with the existing No Fear Act Notification and Federal Employee Anti-Discrimination and Retaliation of 2002 (No Fear Act) Public Law No. 107-174). Organizations should review the relevant law to ensure that their public websites meet the full range of requirements.

{{< box >}}
##### Required link text:
`No Fear Act Data` or `Equal Employment`

##### Required on:
- The homepage of your agency's principal website

##### Required by:
- [Final rule issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2006-08-02/html/E6-12432.htm){{< / box >}}

{{< card-policy src="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2006-08-02/html/E6-12432.htm" kicker="Policy" title="Final rule issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission" >}}

**Link Location, Link Name, Search Engines and URLs**

Section 1614.703(d) of the interim rule requires an agency to title its posted EEO information _Equal Employment Opportunity Data Posted Pursuant to the No Fear Act_. {{< highlight >}}This section further requires an agency to prominently place a hyperlink to the data on the homepage of its public Web site.{{< /highlight >}} There was some objection both to the location of the hyperlink and its name.

As for the location, agencies argue that their homepages already are well populated with hyperlinks which primarily are mission- specific. Adding another hyperlink, thereby producing crowding, may in fact be counter-productive. Moreover, many people visiting an agency Web site do so through hyperlinks from other non-agency Web sites or search engines that bypass an agency's homepage. Some agencies allow internet users to compose a personal homepage, which again bypasses the agency's standard homepage. For these and other reasons, the agencies that commented uniformly were of the opinion that a hyperlink on an agency's homepage is not the best way to ensure the public's assess to an agency's posted EEO data. {{< highlight >}}These agencies therefore suggested that each agency decide itself where to place its EEO data and hyperlinks to that data since each agency best knows where a target audience goes to look for certain information. A number of agencies offered suggestions where the hyperlink would be better placed, such as on the "About the Agency" or "Working for the Agency/Employment" pages.{{< /highlight >}}

The Commission is concerned that without a uniform hyperlink location members of the public seeking EEO data from more than one agency will have trouble finding the data. If one agency's hyperlink is on the "About the Agency" page, another's is on the "Employment Opportunities" page, another's is on a page entitled "Civil Rights", and another's is on the homepage, locating the data for multiple agencies could well end up as an exercise in trial and error. Even assuming that the homepage is not the best or most intuitive location for the hyperlink, EEOC is convinced that it would not be in the public interest to allow each agency to decide where on its Web site it will place the hyperlink. Thus, if not the homepage, EEOC must dictate another uniform location. The problem is that there are no other locations common to all agency public Web sites. Agencies do not label their "About the Agency" and "Employment" pages identically. Not every agency has an Employment Opportunities page. Thus, there is no way to standardize through a rule an alternative location for the link. This leaves only the homepage as the one Web page all agencies possess in common, and therefore it is the homepage which shall house the link.

Regarding the title of the hyperlink, EEOC agrees that it is too wordy. EEOC, however, does not agree that the label "No FEAR" will be widely misunderstood by members of the public. On the contrary, the term "No FEAR Act" has attained familiarity among employees and those involved in EEO matters. Accordingly, {{< highlight >}}the final rule provides that the hyperlink shall be called "No FEAR Act Data"{{< /highlight >}}. However, agencies will be required to title the page where its data appears as follows:

> "Equal Employment Opportunity Data Posted Pursuant to Title III of the Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (No FEAR Act), Pub. L. 107-174."

In furtherance of making every agency's No FEAR Act data easily accessible, it was suggested that agencies maintain their posted data so that it is readily retrievable by commercial search engines. EEOC agrees and has added a subsection setting forth this requirement.

Finally, some commenters suggested that each agency provide EEOC with the hyperlink to its No FEAR data and that EEOC post the agency hyperlinks in one location on EEOC's public Web site. EEOC has decided to adopt this suggestion. Therefore, the final rule contains the requirement that an agency provide EEOC with the URL for the location of its No FEAR data and provide URL updates as necessary. Agencies can e-mail their URLs to EEOC at NoFEAR.URLS@eeoc.gov.{{< / card-policy >}}

_These requirements apply to executive departments and agencies and their public websites. Check the specific law to see if it also applies to the judicial or legislative agencies, or to intranets._

_**The Federal Web Managers Council** recommends that government agencies use consistent link labels for common content found on government websites. These recommendations are based on industry standard link labels and a usability study of common government terms [usability study of common government terms](http://www.slideshare.net/DigitalGov/icgi-content-standards-usability-test-results "ICGI Content Standards: Usability Test Results, Content Managers’ Forum, July 15, 2004") (MS PowerPoint, 144 KB, 49 slides, July 2004)._
