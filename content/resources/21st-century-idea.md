The president signed the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act—otherwise known as [21st Century IDEA](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text)—into law in December 2018. The Act aims to improve the digital government customer experience by reinforcing existing requirements for federal public websites. 

The current state of federal websites and digital services is not ideal. We can, and should, do more. 21st Century IDEA is a way to make this change happen, and it provides a clear, practical path forward. This is a significant opportunity to improve the lives of the public, and public servants, by transforming how government uses technology.

So what is 21st Century IDEA? The bill’s sponsor, Representative Ro Khanna, summed it up by saying, “Government exists to serve citizens, and this bill ensures government leverages available technology to provide cohesive, user-friendly online service that people around this country expect and deserve.”

When it comes to online services, we all have to do a better job. Customer expectations are being ratcheted up by the private sector. Government services should be delivered in ways the public now demands and expects—on the go, fast, easy, secure, and accessible. 

### Requirements

_High-level requirements in 21st Century IDEA._

21st Century IDEA speaks to the omnichannel experience of our customers. It requires all executive branch agencies to: 

- modernize their websites,
- digitize services and forms,
- accelerate use of e-signatures, and 
- improve customer experience. 

It also encourages agencies to standardize and transition to centralized shared services. 

### Website Modernization

21st Century IDEA outlines eight requirements for all new websites and digital services intended for use by the public. 

1. **Accessible** - accessible to individuals with disabilities in accordance with [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/)
2. **Consistent** - have a consistent appearance
3. **Authoritative** - be authoritative and not duplicate existing websites
4. **Searchable** - contain a search function
5. **Secure** - provide a secure connection
6. **User-Centric** - be user-centered and designed around user needs
7. **Customizable** - provide an option for a more customized digital experience
8. **Mobile-friendly** - be usable on mobile devices

### Reporting

_Reports Due to Congress and OMB/Public_

- Agencies must identify high-impact sites and services and prioritize them for modernization
- Though all sites need a modernization review, we’re only required to report on high-impact sites
- Report the list of sites to Congress
- Report modernization plans/progress to OMB/public each December for next five years
