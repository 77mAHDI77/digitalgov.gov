The [Connected Government Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2331) (H.R.2331) was signed into law on January 10, 2018, and requires new and redesigned federal agency public websites to be mobile-friendly. The [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA) and [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) (OMB) will submit a report to Congress in 2019 that describes how agencies can implement the law and assess their compliance.



The new law codifies OMB Memorandum M-17-06, [Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf) (PDF, 1.2 MB, 18 pages, November 2016).

## What is mobile friendly?

A mobile friendly website can be navigated, viewed and accessed on a smartphone, tablet computer, or similar mobile device, according to the law.
