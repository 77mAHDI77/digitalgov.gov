The Federal Web Council was launched in January 2004 as an interagency group of federal web managers working together to improve the delivery of U.S. government information and services online. It provides a forum for high-level cross-agency collaboration, and recommends policies and guidelines for all public U.S. federal websites.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Federal Web Council is to:

- Provide a venue for agency web and digital leaders to share, discuss, and collaborate on digital best practices for the federal government;
- Serve as the point of contact and a source of expertise for the White House, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, and other key stakeholders on policy related to federal digital services;
- Facilitate implementation of laws and policies impacting federal digital services, including the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text) (21st Century IDEA), the [Connected Government Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2331), and [M-17-06 Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf) (PDF, 1.2 MB, 18 pages, November 2016).

## Membership

Membership is comprised of federal agency Web Directors and Deputy Directors. Participating agencies include the 24 [CFO Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Financial_Officers_Act) agencies, and other select federal agencies that provide high-impact services to the public. Membership is invitation-only.

If youâ€™re a federal employee working on web and digital services, and wish to contribute and collaborate with colleagues from across government, consider joining the [Web Content Managers Forum](https://digital.gov/communities/web-content-managers/), or any of the other [Digital.gov communities of practice](https://digital.gov/communities/).

## Leadership

The Web Council is led by two co-chairs; one from the General Services Administration, as the sponsoring agency, and the other from one of the member agencies. The agency co-chair occasionally rotates. The current co-chairs are:

- [Rachel Flagg](mailto:rachel.flagg@gsa.gov) - Content Strategist at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP)
