Communities unite federal teams with over 12,000 memberships across 16 active mission areas—the largest and most active inter-agency network of transformative federal government managers—as critical mission hubs that provide a platform for sharing, developing and implementing strategies.

Their contributions are limitless in their impact, including the introduction of citizen voice platforms like [Yelp for public services](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/08/07/five-star-customer-experience-in-public-service-with-yelp/) and [Artificial Intelligence for customer service](https://www.digitalgov.gov/event/automatic-for-the-people-ai-machine-learning-and-chatbots-for-digital-customer-service-in-government/), the support of more than [700 prizes and competitions](https://www.challenge.gov/list/), inter-Community platforms like [the U.S. Digital Registry](https://medium.com/@GeneralServicesAdministration/new-u-s-digital-registry-authenticates-official-public-service-accounts-1f8120d67976#.uf6fsnw2g), development of the [U.S. Public Participation Playbook](https://participation.usa.gov/) and other resources for [Cyber-Security](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/readiness-recovery-response-social-media-cyber-vandalism-toolkit/) and [Accessibility for persons with Disabilities](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/improving-the-accessibility-of-social-media-in-government/), and [mobile products](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/mobile-application-testing-program/) that put services in the hands of citizens.

## Community Guidelines

While the makeup of every individual Community may be unique—whether featuring collaborative channels, listservs, workshops, training and/or blog posts—they all share a commitment to data-driven problem solving, learning, and the development of shared solutions.

In order to maintain an official Community, facilitators must provide the following:

  * Mission statement
  * Intended outcomes achievable within six months and one year
  * Performance measurements to gauge the impact, growth or other factors
  * Strategy to share insights from the Community to other groups and the public

Members of a Community must use official .gov or .mil email addresses, and understand that they are acting in their official capacities represented through their U.S. government agencies, and subject to the Freedom of Information Act and other related laws and standards.

For more information on Communities, or to propose a new inter-agency network, please [email Justin Herman](mailto:justin.herman@gsa.gov).
