Welcome to DigitalGov, let us tell you a little bit about what we're working on...

There's an innovation movement in government that sees a need to have centralized resources to help government be more innovative and digitally-focused. Agencies need:

* Help implementing executive and congressionally mandated digital policies and initiatives.
* Connection points between government teams, change agents, and idea labs across government to encourage collaborating, sharing and learning.
* Open access to resources, communities, and training to build a more innovative, digital and efficient government.

During the past several years (and through its earlier iterations) DigitalGov has become a destination in government to learn about methods, practices, policies and tools needed to create these effective digital services.

And now we are taking DigitalGov even further.

We believe DigitalGov should set the example for how government **learns**, **builds**, **delivers** and **measures** digital services in the 21st century. We are going to start by telling the story of how we are rebuilding DigitalGov from the ground up - from the specific challenges we are facing, to the tools we are using to overcome them using the services and tools GSA provides.

Our job is also to know everything about the government teams running digital services in the federal government - their successes and wins, what their challenges are, where they are blocked or need additional support.

We want to amplify those successes and offer guidance to overcome the blockers that prevent effective government digital services.
