**The Digital.gov Newsletter** is a round-up of innovative work, news and ideas from people and teams across government. It also includes a list of the upcoming community events and training aimed at elevating our digital expertise.

Our newsletter is sent out every Tuesday morning _(with the exception of holiday weeks)_.

Our strategy is to provide you with just the right amount of information to help you and your team make something 5% better. We’re not interested in flooding your inbox with emails you don’t need.

That said — while we aim to send one email each week, we may occasionally send stand alone emails with important news items or product launches. Though we'll keep those emails to a minimum.
