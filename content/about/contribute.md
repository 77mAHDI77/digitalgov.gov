## Virtual Student Federal Service — #ApplyInJuly to Be an Intern for the Innovation Portfolio

Are you a U.S. college student looking for a way to make a real difference in the work of your government, while also gaining job experience and connections?

Through the [Virtual Student Federal Service (VSFS) program](https://vsfs.state.gov/), students can work on projects that advance the work of government on multiple fronts. Tech-related projects include developing virtual programs, engaging in digital communications, data analysis, graphic design, and building apps.

U.S. students **apply** to their top three VSFS projects from **July 1** to **July 31** on [USAJOBS.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov/). VSFS supervisors will review applications between August 1 and August 31 and may contact VSFS candidates for a virtual interview. As part of the interview, candidates may be asked to show examples of their expertise and work. All candidates will hear by **early September 2019** if they have been offered a position.

Selected interns work on their projects for 10 hours each week, from September 2019 through May 2020. Some interns work with their academic institutions to receive course credit for their VSFS participation.
