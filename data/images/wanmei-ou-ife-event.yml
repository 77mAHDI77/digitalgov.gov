alt      : "Wanmei Ou, at a 2019 Institute for Education event. She is speaking to a group of seated people while holding a microphone in her right hand. In her left hand, she holds up a sheet of paper with photos of four people to see if they can tell which one is a photo of a real human being, and which three photos are computer-generated."
