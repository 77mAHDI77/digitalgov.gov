# How to edit this file
# ---------------------

# What to know ----------------------
# 1. Each "card" on the homepage requires a 'file' and 'type'.
# 2. Keep the tab spacing on the left consistent. Everything else is just cosmetic.

# Keys ----------------------
# file = this is the actual filename of the page you want to link to (e.g. challenges-prizes.md)
# type = controls the presentation of the card, based on type of media
#        (post | video)

# - file          : '2018-04-03-thinking-about-going-agile-5-benefits-your-office-will-reap-with-agile-methods.md'
#   type          : 'post'
